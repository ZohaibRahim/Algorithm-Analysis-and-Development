# BigInteger Arithmetic Operations Benchmarking

This Java project evaluates the performance of arithmetic operations, specifically addition and multiplication, using the BigInteger class. The goal is to analyze the execution time of these operations as the size of the operands (in bits) increases. The project includes a detailed examination of the StopWatch class used for accurate time measurement.

**COMPONENT:**
StopWatch Class:
1) The StopWatch class provides accurate timing measurements for the benchmarking process.
2) It ensures precise measurement using System.nanoTime() for capturing short durations.
3) Methods include start(), stop(), reset(), and elapsed().

Addition Benchmark (TestAddition):
1) Measures the execution time of BigInteger addition with varying operand sizes.
2) Outputs include execution time for different bit lengths and an analysis of the observed trends.

Multiplication Benchmark (TestMultiplication):
1) Evaluates the execution time of BigInteger multiplication for different operand sizes.
2) Provides insights into the relationship between operand size and execution time.

Observations and Analysis:
1) Detailed observations on the relationship between operand size and execution time for addition and multiplication.
2) Scalability trends, including factors affecting performance for different operand sizes.

Accuracy Assurance:
1) Discussion on the accuracy of the StopWatch class and the reliability of the benchmarking methodology.

**Usage:**
1) Run TestAddition to benchmark addition operations.
2) Run TestMultiplication to benchmark multiplication operations.

**Key Findings:**
1) Both addition and multiplication operations exhibit varying execution times with increasing operand sizes.
2) Analysis of scalability trends and factors influencing performance.
3) Considerations for understanding the underlying complexities of BigInteger arithmetic operations.

**Note:**
1) The project provides insights into the performance characteristics of BigInteger operations under different scenarios.
2) The StopWatch class ensures accurate timing measurements, contributing to reliable benchmarking results.
